InfectedPlugin
==============

This is a plugin designed to attack servers. Never expect any "stable" updates to InfectedPlugin, there may be certain bug-fix updates etc etc, but don't expect any permenant stability updates other than bukkit updates.

The plugin will live on for official updates until all official Developers decide to cancel InfectedPlugin, however, when we are done with InfectedPlugin, we will make sure the final update works and is stable.

We do however accept "Forks" for non-official updates to InfectedPlugin, go ahead and fork InfectedPlugin if you wish to update. However, unless you are doing a major rewrite of the plugin, do not take credit from the official Developers. See more info at LICENSE.md.

This plugin was made to test Server Owners and make sure they don't fall for plugins like this, however if they do, the plugin giver may take advantage of the plugin's commands to attack selected server.

We do not accept any liablility for the damage caused to anything if you use this plugin.

The plugin is licenced under "All Rights Reserved".
